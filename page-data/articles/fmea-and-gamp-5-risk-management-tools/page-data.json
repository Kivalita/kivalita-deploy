The effect this uncertainty has\non the organization's objectives is called \"risk\". Whatever the type\nof risk, it has this denomination because it has the uncertainty factor to\noccur, but not that it is necessarily just something bad that can happen. </p><p>\nThat said, there are two tools that are heavily used for risk management of\nGAMP 5 and FMEA. </p><p><strong>\nGAMP 5</strong></p><p> Called Good Automated Manufacturing Practice (in Portuguese Good Automated\nManufacturing Practices), widely used in the industrial industry, analyzes and\nevaluates risk in a simplified way with the qualitative criteria of\n\"Low\", \"Medium\" and \"High\". </p><p>This tool allows risk\ncontrol (assessing whether it is good or bad) and requires the periodicity of\nreview of each risk in order to minimize all \"status\" of criticality\nresulting from negative or bad risks to \"Low\" and promote the risks\ndetected as positive to \"High\". \nGamp 5 is developed through a form where risks must initially be\nidentified, assessing the probability and severity of the risk and, obtaining\nthe classification of this risk, its detection is evaluated to name the\nresulting final factor: Risk priority.</p><p><strong> \nFMEA</strong></p><p>According to SAKURADA, this tool, called Failure Mode and Effect Analysis,\nuses a qualitative method, relating failure mode and effects, and analyzes how\nfailures manifest themselves. It can avoid past problems and be mechanism for\ndetecting future failures.\nIt develops through a form where the detected risks and their effects are\nanalyzed, there is a quantitative classification in order to map the severity\nof each risk. \n&nbsp;\n</p><p>The FMEA risk analysis tool is more detailed in prevention and detection\ncontrol, besides being a tool with greater margin of assessment on each risk\naddressed, considering points from 1 to 10 in the assessment of risk severity,\nprobability of occurrence and detection of failure.&nbsp;</p><p>The GAMP 5 risk analysis tool, because it is more simplified, scores the\nrisk at only 3 points, being \"High\", \"Medium\" or\n\"Low\". On the other hand, it is a rapid and effective analysis for\nevaluating qualitative processes.\n</p><p>Both tools unanimously resulted as preventive action in mitigating the\nnegative risks detected (most of which are the source of coding management\nfailures, organization and planning of documentation) the development of an\nautomated or computerized system that minimizes human intervention for\nrepetitive processes that can be easily performed through a computer.\n</p><p>As a recommendation, the development of risk management is essential to\nprevent failures that strongly impact business continuity.\n</p><p><em><strong>Reference: ALVES, Barbara Guelfi.
