For this\nwe came here to show you that a quiet adaptation can be made through a planning\noutlined in all the principles that the law deals with, through GAP ANALYSIS.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Process\nmapping and GAP ANALYSIS</strong></p><p>\nIf you have visited our website, you should know the Gap Analysis, the method thatKivalita Consulting has to perform\na diagnosis in a business to check the gaps based on some legislation.\nThinking about it, even if it is an internal procedure, it is necessary to\nperform a mapping based on the LGPD of the whole company and check in order of\ncriticality which gaps need to be solved, and from this information it will be\npossible to create your planning and also check which team will be responsible\nfor the project, and which professionals need training to understand the\nadequacy process. </p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> Company\nAwareness (Training)</span></strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Planning</span></strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Implementation</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><strong> Monitoring</strong></span></p><p>\nThe other adequacy phases are always guided by the final GAP Analysis\nreport. Therefore, without this first step, the process can become much more\ntime consuming and costly, besides not adapting to the overview of every\nbusiness, and can generate \"sectorized\" planning, without considering\nthe interrelations between the processes, which in this case make the real\nsolution impossible.</p><p> \nDon't skip steps,\nshortcuts can be expensive! \nSafety and\nquality are fundamental to business health. </p><p>Contact us and pray for a GAP\nANALYSIS without obligation! It costs less than you think!</p>","published":true,"createdAt":"2020-10-22T19:49:15.7412426","imageId":223,"postImage":{"id":223,"type":"Blog","fileName":"08c600ab-56d6-47d0-a01e-d3d7ad0ec9e8.jpg","imageData":null,"imageUrl":"https://kivalitaapi.azurewebsites.net/resources/images/08c600ab-56d6-47d0-a01e-d3d7ad0ec9e8.jpg","url":null,"imageString":null},"authorId":13,"imageData":null,"language":0,"isNews":false,"isLegislation":false,"linkId":116,"translateSlug":"lgpd---sua-empresa-ja-esta-preparada-temos-um-metodo-rapido-para-saber"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["4202924991"]}
